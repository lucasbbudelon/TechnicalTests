#Description
Consider the following structure being used to store a binary tree.

 ```csharp
    class Node
	{
	  public int Value;
	  public Node Right;
	  public Node Left;
	}
 ```

 You want to write a method that receives the root node and returns the count of nodes in the tree.

 ```csharp
    public int GetNodeCount(Node root)
	{
	}
 ```

 Complete the implementation of the GetNodeCount method. Feel free to create other methods that you may deem necessary.
